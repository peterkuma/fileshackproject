			        <strong>Drag and drop. </strong>
			        Files can be uploaded by dropping them into a box.
			        If that is not convenient, a traditional upload dialog can be opened by clicking the box.

			        <strong>Chunk upload. </strong>
			        Files are uploaded by chunks, so that when a transfer
			        is interrupted, it can be resumed.
			        Files of GB's in size can be uploaded.

			        <strong>HTML5. </strong>
			        Fileshack leverages many features of HTML5 such as File API, Drag & Drop and CSS3.
			        However, it is backward-compatible with browsers which do not support these features.

			        <strong>Django. </strong>
			        Fileshack uses the python development framework django.
