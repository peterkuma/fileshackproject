<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>
Fileshack can be hosted on your own server or on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google AppEngine</a>.
While the latter is better if you prefer hosting for free (up to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/quotas">a certain
amount of traffic</a>), the former means you do not have to disclose your files to a third
party.
</p>

<h3>Native Installation</h3>
<p>Fileshack is based on the web development framework <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>.
In order to deploy fileshack on your server, you first need to have a working web server such as
<a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> or <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a>.
There are countless ways of deploying Django.
One of the most popular and simple combinations is Apache and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a>,
which will be covered here. Other convenient combinations are Apache or nginx with
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/fastcgi/">FastCGI</a>
or <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">gunicorn</a>, possibly with Django run on startup by <a href="http://supervisord.org/">supervisord</a>.
It should also be possible to run fileshack on Windows with IIS. You will sure
be able to find instructions for installing Django projects in these other combinations on the web.</p>

<h4>Apache and mod_wsgi</h4>
<p>If you run a Linux or a BSD distribution, both Apache and mod_wsgi are likely
available via the distribution's packaging system.
We will put Django and fileshack inside a <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>.
Assuming Apache, mod_wsgi and virtualenv are installed, follow these steps:</p>

<div class="note">Substitute your preferred installation directory for
<var><em>/home/user/www/fs/</em></var> and your domain for <var><em>fileshack.example.org</em></var>.</div>

<ol>
	<li>
		Create a new virtualenv:
		<div class="cmd">
			mkdir -p <em>/home/user/www</em><br />
			cd <em>/home/user/www</em><br />
			python3 -m venv fs<br />
			cd fs<br />
			. bin/activate
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Install django inside the virtual environment:
		<div class="cmd">
			pip3 install django
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Clone the fileshackproject repository:
		<div class="cmd">
			git clone git://github.com/peterkuma/fileshackproject.git<br />
			cd fileshackproject<br />
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Copy and customize the local settings example file:
		<div class="cmd">
			cp fileshackproject/settings_local-example.py fileshackproject/settings_local.py<br />
			vi fileshackproject/settings_local.py
		</div>
		Normally, you do not need to modify anything except for <var>ADMINS</var>,
		<var>SECRET_KEY</var>, and uncommenting
		<var>DEBUG = False</var> once your installation works properly.
	</li>
	<li>
		Initialize database:
		<div class="cmd">
			./manage.py migrate --run-syncdb<br />
			./manage.py createsuperuser
		</div>
		You will be asked to create a superuser account, by which you
		can later log in to the administration interface at
		<var>http://<em>fileshack.example.org</em>/admin/</var>.
		This command also creates a default store.
	</li>
	<li>
		Collect static files into the <var>static</var> directory:
		<div class="cmd">
			./manage.py collectstatic --noinput
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		At this point you can try to run fileshack with the integrated development server:
		<div class="cmd">
		    ./manage.py runserver<br />
		</div>
		The default store should be accessible at
		<a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>.
		If everything works fine, continue with setting up Apache.
	</li>
	<li>
		Make sure Apache has a permission to write to <var>db</var>,
		the database file <var>db/fileshack.sqlite</var> and <var>media</var>.
		<div class="cmd">
			sudo chown www-data db db/fileshack.sqlite media
		</div>
		<p><var>media</var> is the directory where fileshack stores the uploaded files.
		If you like, you can make it a symlink to a different directory on the
		file system.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Create a new virtual host in the Apache configuration:
		<div class="code">
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ServerName <em>fileshack.example.org</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DocumentRoot <em>/home/user/www/fs/</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/fileshack_error.log<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CustomLog /var/log/apache2/fileshack_access.log common<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Location /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options -Indexes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/Location&gt;<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alias /static/ <em>/home/user/www/fs</em>/fileshackproject/static/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alias /media/ <em>/home/user/www/fs</em>/fileshackproject/media/<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WSGIScriptAlias / <em>/home/user/www/fs</em>/fileshackproject/fileshackproject/wsgi_virtualenv.py<br />&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
		</div>
		<div class="note">
			<var>wsgi_virtualenv.py</var> is the WSGI application for use with virtualenv. Use <var>wsgi.py</var>
			instead if you decide not to use virtualenv.
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Test the configuration and restart apache:
		<div class="cmd">
			apache2ctl configtest<br />
			apache2ctl restart
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Fileshack should now be accessible at <var>http://<em>fileshack.example.org</em></var>.
		You can manage stores in the administration interface at
		<var>http://<em>fileshack.example.org</em>/admin/</var>.
		You are advised to protect the default store by an access code.
		If you encounter any problems, drop an e-mail to the mailing list at
		<a href="mailto:fileshack-general@lists.sourceforge.net">fileshack-general@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
		<div class="note">
			Do not forget to set <var>DEBUG = False</var> in
			<var>settings_local.py</var>
			before going public. Otherwise, users are presented with
			ugly HTTP 404 and HTTP 500 pages, potentially revealing sensitive
			information. Moreover, the django project is configured
			to serve static files, which is strongly discouraged in production
			environments (this should be the task of the web server).
		</div>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="store-watching">Store Watching (optional)</h3>
<p>Fileshack allows users to opt in to receive e-mail notifications when
new files are uploaded. When enabled, a <strong>Watch</strong> button
is displayed next to the <strong>Logout</strong> button, allowing users
to enter an e-mail address to which to send notifications.
However, several more steps need to be taken in order to support
this feature.
</p>

<h5>Cron</h5>

<p>If you want your fileshack installation to support store watching,
you have to set up periodic requests to the service which
sends the notifications:</p>

<div class="code">
http://<em>fileshack.example.org</em>/cron/
</div>

<p>For security reasons, access to this URL is allowed only from hosts specified
in the configuration variable <var>FILESHACK_CRON_HOSTS</var>, or to those who
present with the shared secret <var>FILESHACK_CRON_SECRET</var>.</p>

<p>On Linux and other unix-like systems, periodic requests to a URL can be
accomplished by a scheduled command in the system daemon
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a>.
In order to schedule such a request every 10 minutes,
create a file <var>/etc/cron.d/fileshack</var>:

<div class="code">
# Run scheduled tasks of the web application fileshack.<br />
#<br />
*/10	 * * * * <em>user</em> python -c 'import sys, httplib; c=httplib.HTTPConnection("<em>fileshack.example.org</em>"); c.request("POST","/cron/","secret=<em>yoursecret</em>"); r=c.getresponse(); r.status==200 or sys.stdout.write(r.read())'
</div>

<p>Replace <em>user</em> with your username, and
<em>fileshack.example.org</em> with the correct
hostname of your fileshack installation.</p>

<p>If the hostname is not <strong>localhost</strong>,
you will have to set up a shared secret.
Replace <em>yoursecret</em> in the command above with your chosen
secret, and set <var>FILESHACK_CRON_SECRET</var> in
<var>fileshackproject/settings_local.py</var> to the same value.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can add the IP address of the cron machine to
<var>FILESHACK_CRON_HOSTS</var>. In this case, you do not have to
supply the shared secret. By default,
<var>FILESHACK_CRON_HOSTS</var> contains only <strong>localhost</strong>.</p>

<div class="note">If anything goes wrong with the cron command, you should
receive an e-mail with the command output on your user account from cron.
In any case, you can test by executing the python command above in the console.
Alternatively, the same can be accomplised more simply with:

<div class="code">
curl -d secret=<em>yoursecret</em> http://<em>fileshack.example.org</em>/cron/
</div>
</div>

<h5>Settings</h5>
<p>Store watching requires several configuration variables to be set up
properly â€” mail server settings EMAIL_*, FILESHACK_EMAIL_FROM and SECRET_KEY
in <var>fileshackproject/settings_local.py</var>.
Mail server settings are described in detail in the
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/">django documentation</a>.
</p>

<div class="note">
You have reload Apache in order for the new settings to be applied.
</div>

<div class="note">If you do not set <var>SECRET_KEY</var>,
users will not be able to unsubscribe
via a link in notification messages. These links are protected
by HMAC, which requires a private secret.
</div>

<h5>Admin</h5>

<p>In <strong>Sites</strong>, modify the <strong>example.org</strong>
domain to reflect your domain setting.</p>

<p>Finally, you can enable <strong>Allow watch</strong>
in your chosen stores. To prevent bothering users
with copious amounts of messages, at most one notification is sent
per 6-hour period to a particular e-mail address.
This can be tuned by the <strong>Watch delay</strong>
option.</p>

<h3>Deployment on Google AppEngine</h3>
<p>Google AppEngine is an application hosting service provided by Google.
The good thing about AppEngine is that your application is hosted for free
as long as you stay below rather high limits of bandwidth and storage
capacity. The bad thing is that it requires a special API to be used for
managing files, which prevents fileshack from running as efficiently as a
native installation, and some features such as downloading of unfinished
files are not supported. The demo on this site is hosted on Google AppEngine.</p>

<p>If you decided to deploy fileshack on Google AppEngine, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<a href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=ah&amp;passive=true&amp;continue=https://appengine.google.com/_ah/conflogin%3Fcontinue%3Dhttps://appengine.google.com/&amp;ltmpl=ae">
		Create an Google account</a> (if you do not have any), and log in.
		Go to <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">Google AppEngine</a>
		and create a new application. Choose <strong>High Replication</strong>
		as the storage mode, and an <strong>Application Identifier</strong>
		of your preference.
	</li>
	<li>
		Prepare a clean working directory for the deployment:
		<div class="cmd">
			mkdir /home/user/fileshack<br />
			cd /home/user/fileshack
		</div>
	<li>
		Download <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python">Google App Engine SDK for Python</a>
		and unpack it into the working directory. Add it the PATH environment
		variable:
		<div class="cmd">
			export PATH="$PATH:/home/user/fileshack/google_appengine"
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Clone repositories from the django-nonrel project into the working directory:
		<div class="cmd">
			hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/django-nonrel<br />
			hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/djangoappengine<br />
			hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/djangotoolbox<br />
			hg clone https://bitbucket.org/twanschik/django-autoload<br />
			hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/django-dbindexer<br />
		</div>
		<div class="note">If you do not want to use <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a> (hg),
		you can download them from <a href="https://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine">allbuttonspressed.com</a>.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Clone the appengine branch of fileshack into the working directory:
		<div class="cmd">
			git clone -b appengine git://github.com/peterkuma/fileshackproject.git<br />
			cd fileshackproject
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Open app.yaml and set <em>application:</em> to the <strong>Application Identifier</strong>
		you chose when you created the application on Google AppEngine.
		<div class="cmd">
			vi app.yaml
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Copy and customize the local settings example file:
		<div class="cmd">
			cp fileshackproject/settings_local-example.py fileshackproject/settings_local.py<br />
			vi fileshackproject/settings_local.py
		</div>
		<p>Normally, you do not need to modify anything except for <var>ADMINS</var> and uncommenting
		<var>DEBUG = False</var> once your installation works properly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Collect static files into the <var>static</var> directory:
		<div class="cmd">
			./manage.py collectstatic --noinput
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Run server locally. Is everything OK?
		<div class="cmd">
			./manage.py runserver
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Deploy! You will be asked for your Google Account login details
		in the process. The process will also create a new django
		superuser account (say yes when prompted).
		<div class="cmd">
			./manage.py deploy
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		Go to the django administration console at
		<var>http://<em>appidentifier</em>.appspot.com/admin/</var>,
		and log in with the superuser account. Create a new Store
		with an empty <em>Path</em>, empty <em>Media</em>,
		and <em>Access code</em> of your choice.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fileshack should now be accessible at <var>http://<em>appidentifier</em>.appspot.com</var>,
		and your Google administration console at <a href="https://appspot.com">https://appspot.com</a>.
		If you encounter any problems, drop an e-mail to the mailing list at
		<a href="mailto:fileshack-general@lists.sourceforge.net">fileshack-general@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.

<h2 id="howdoesitwork">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Fileshack uses one of the following methods of uploading a file,
listed from the most sophisticated to the least sophisticated:
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>XMLHttpRequest with File API.</strong> File is read into browser
		memory by FileReader and uploaded by chunks. During upload, chunk size
		is tuned so that an optimal upload time is achieved. If upload fails,
		it can be resumed by starting from the last uploaded chunk. File
		upload progress is show.
		This method is supported by Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera.
		However, as Opera does not support XMLHttpRequest.upload,
		upload progress is coarse (by chunks).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>XMLHttpRequest with FormData.</strong> File is upload
		in full by XMLHttpRequest.send(FormData). Resume of a failed
		upload is not supported. Upload progress is indicated.
		This method is chosen for browers not supporting File API, such
		as Safari.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Submitting a hidden iframe.</strong> This is a trick
		allowing submitting a file without displaying a file input element.
		Click on the dropbox is delegated to a file input element inside
		a hidden iframe, in order to circumvent a security check in IE not
		allowing to submit a form when a click was delegated.
		No progress indication is supported.
		This method is supported by browsers such as IE8 and IE9.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Explicit file input element.</strong>
		An input element is displayed inside the dropbox.
		This method is chosen for browsers such as IE7.
	</li>
</ol>
